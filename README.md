## What is Veganalysis?
A study by Oxford University concluded that the single most impactful action a person can do to help the environment is to go vegan.

Veganalysis aims to do it's part to help the environment by demonstrating how one simple change can have such a dramatic positive impact.

Simply search for a recipe, and Veganalysis will suggest simple substitutions to "veganise" the recipe. What's more, Veganalysis will calculate how much Carbon Dioxide Equivalent gas is saved by following the substitutions.

### How was Veganalysis made?
Veganalysis's MVP was launced after it was made for the Lockdoneathon hackathon in August 2020.
It is built using React, HTML, CSS and a sprinkle of vanilla JS.
View the github repo.
Veganalysis was built by William Harding.
Disclaimer: Veganalysis is a work in progress, and the data used to inform substitutions and calculations is incomplete, so you may see some non-vegan ingredients that are not flagged / may not have a substitute, or vegan ingredients that have accidentally been flagged as non-vegan.

### Next steps
* Implement recipe sharing through social media
* Apply ingredient changes to the method as well as the ingredients list
* Allow users to log in to save recipes
* Allow users to make their own suggestions of substitutions
* Expand substitutions dataset
* Add references for carbon footprint calculations
